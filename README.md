Day 11 Task of Cohort 2 #30DaysOfCode

For this challenge, I tried to rebuild a version of [this](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/portfolio-ed4711f4-74ff-4f9a-aad8-08fbc51badaa) but with a few tweaks here and there

Here is my final screen

Other screenshots as I went through the development process can be found [here](https://github.com/geektutor/day11/blob/master/screenshot/) 

I learnt CustomPaint majorly with this task and how to work with SingleChildScrollView. I also learnt how to use url launcher to open links in a web browser.
